# Putting it all together

Let's quickly recap all of the things we learned in this course:

1. Combine files
2. Replace social sharing buttons
3. Inline Critical Path CSS
4. Load JS in the footer
5. Remove whitespace
6. Load fonts asynchronously
7. Pick the right image format
8. Smush and compress images
9. Switch to SVG
10. Use responsive images
11. Remove the tap delay
12. Enable gzip
13. Enable expires headers
14. Use a caching plugin

## Remeasure your site performance

Once you've finished making your performance improvements, lets measure your site's performance in WebPagetest^[[http://www.webpagetest.org/](http://www.webpagetest.org/)] again to see how you've improved.

As a reminder, here are our Start Render targets:

- On a cable connection, you want this number to be 1,000ms (1 second) or lower.
- On a 3g connection, you want this number to be 3,000ms (3 seconds) or lower.
- On an EDGE network, you want this number to be 5,000ms (5 seconds) or lower.

If you take nothing else away from this course, I hope you'll remember that perceived performance matters more than actual performance.
